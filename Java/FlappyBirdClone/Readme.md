# Flappy Bird Clone made for a Java 1 Development class
This is just the main code for the game, it uses gradle & libgdx and as you can see this is missing lots of necessary files.
Reason for that is me losing the original code since I did not know git too well at the time.
Doesnt even have the pngs. Yet this is all the core logic needed to recreate the game.
